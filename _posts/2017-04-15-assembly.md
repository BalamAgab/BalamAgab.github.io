The Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council (MACC) is inviting you to our next general assembly, April 15th at Verso Books, to continue discussing plans for the upcoming Mayday (May 1st) demonstrations. MACC Assemblies are open to all anarchists and those interested in anarchist ideas and organizing so please invite your friends and share widely!

An orientation will precede the assembly starting at 12:00 NOON for those interested in familiarizing themselves with the history, process and politics that underskirt general assemblies and anarchist organizational models.

This year’s Mayday demonstrations have the potential to be a rallying cry for the wider anti-authoritarian left, with calls circulating for strikes and mass demonstrations that build on the momentum from events like the International Women’s Strike and the Day Without Immigrants.  Mayday represents an opportunity to generalize these various struggles and to build new bonds of solidarity amongst radical anti-capitalists in resistance. Come out and help us to build a successful day of action! 

This general assembly will be formatted slightly differently than previous assemblies, with action oriented planning breakouts rather than working group breakouts.  There will be separate sign-up sheets for those interested in joining a working group.

Current MACC working groups include: MACC Anti-Doxxing (MAD), MACC Emergency Action (MEA), MACC Press, MACC Arts & Propaganda (MAP), MACC Information & Outreach, MACC Legal Support, the Anarcho-Feministas and the MACC Infrastructure Group (MIG).

General Assembly Preliminary Agenda:

* Report backs from MACC working groups
* Mayday Actions & Events
* Breakout groups to plan Mayday event
* PSA
