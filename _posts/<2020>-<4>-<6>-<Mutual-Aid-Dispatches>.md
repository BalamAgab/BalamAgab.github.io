###MUTUAL AID DISPATCHES

It’s been hard to keep track of time since COVID-19 entered our radars, at different times, as a pandemic. Time is
multiplying and extending and shortening all at once. It’s eclipsed by longer naps, shortened by the anxiety of waiting 
to hear from loved ones, and multiplied in the management of impossible expectations. Since a few weeks ago, most of 
what characterized NYC has been shut down. You can hear birds chirping out of your window. Businesses have started foregoing
the posting of COVID-related reasons for closing their doors. 

There’s also been a lot of flourishing--of grocery deliveries, of information networks, of apartment phone trees, of DIY 
mask making, etc. What had seemed the glacially-moving ship of the city has made a wide turn to “mutual aid,” offering new 
ways and routes by which to live together, separately. New Facebook pages, new neighborhood pods and relationships have 
cropped up. Many of us are inundated with resources that are entirely new to us. And amidst what had been the seemingly 
complete absorption of the electoral, even national news outlets have started discussing mutual aid. 

But in the rush of the new and the infrastructures that thrive off feeling the new and the pressures of time, we risk 
repeating the widespread tendency of leftist and radical organizers to forget. Namely, the forgetting of those who have built,
created, and renovated mutual aid networks running when the rest of us were working elsewhere. In the rush to deal with the 
new, we risk repeating a kind of unknowing--of “producing” knowledge in a way that actively erases where it has come from and 
what it has survived. Let’s work to make reference to the places where these practices come from. And when we don’t know, 
let’s take the time to understand from where we’ve received them. 

Towards that end, we’re interested in generating an ongoing and conversational “archive” of mutual aid practices and projects 
that have been running some time, or projects that laid the foundation for things we’re picking up again today--in NYC or 
elsewhere. How can we do a better job talking about and building projects now by understanding the concrete needs and locations
that contextualized former mutual aid projects? What are the already existing projects that we should be joining? 
As we get to know our neighbors and neighborhoods more intimately than ever before, let’s also work to build knowledge of 
those who did the work before us to create the forms of living that are helping us to survive today.
