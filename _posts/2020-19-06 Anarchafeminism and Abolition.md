In the spirit of abolition and building a better world, we honor #Juneteenth today with the MACC Anarchist Feminist working
group’s contribution to <a href= "https://publicseminar.org/2020/05/anarchafeminist-manifesto-1-0/?fbclid=IwAR13iwT9A3pMfrZTrrX9EWoxcwMHVtfr7lhimAGek1nmWOWTrF-ymw7IwZg">Public Seminar anarchafeminist manifesto</a>.

## H2**Anarchafeminsm and Abolition**

Anarchafeminism means abolition of the police and prisons. As anarchafeminists, we recognize that the prison-industrial 
complex is a project that extends beyond physical walls and permeates all of society. This antiblack, ableist, and gender-
normative project maintains the sovereign state, and the sovereign sex. It upholds the dangerous view that a neutral arbiter
of justice and rightful punitive measures exist in a system built upon racism, colonialism, and misogyny. The system is 
not broken. It is working exactly as intended – criminalizing black, brown, indigenous, feminized, and gender nonconforming 
bodies. Treating this violence as an exception, is ahistorical, dangerous, and limits possibilities for real transformation. 

Reforms such as the ones proposed by the 8cantwait campaign, allow the state to appear as if it is responsive to demands for
change, while leaving the same structures and systems intact. In contrast, the non-reformist reforms proposed by 8toabolition,
offer one path forward that reduces the resources that go toward policing and prisons, and increases investments in communities.This is a step in the direction of an abolitionist vision, in which the carceral state, and all states are obsolete.  

Gendered violence is foundational to the development of the state. However, the state’s pathological desire to control 
women’s bodies is exacerbated within the carceral state. Women are the fastest-growing prison population in the so-called 
United States.  As male prison populations decrease in response to criminal justice reforms, women’s incarceration continues 
to grow at an all-time high.  One in 18 Black women will be incarcerated in their/her lifetimes and 47% of Black transgender 
women will be incarcerated. Prisons are inherently spaces of violence and control for everyone, but women also experience 
sexual forms of violence and trauma during incarceration including rape, shackled births, and denial of necessary medical care. At least 1 in 4 women has had an incarcerated loved one, which contributes to decline in mental, emotional, and physical 
health. Incarceration of women and their loved ones is a burgeoning women’s health crisis. 

We recognize that the carceral state was built to maintain a disciplined society, in which gender binaries and norms were
policed. We stand against this political isolation, that maintains a binary and dominant gender by taking women and femmes
away from their resources and support structures. In opposition, we build solidarity through walls and bars by supporting our
incarcerated comrades with acts of care and mutual aid. Our political commitments of abolition, anarchism, and radical feminism break the chains of our oppressors and aim to create a world that renders the prison-industrial complex impossible.
