The Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council (MACC) is hosting our next general assembly on Friday, March 16th at Verso Books. If you haven't attended before, these assemblies are an opportunity to get plugged in with MACC, its various committees and working groups, and other NYC based anarchist projects. 

As with all assemblies, we encourage everyone to come with ideas about what they would like to see for future campaigns or actions and what direction they'd like MACC to take in terms of building a more powerful, militant anarchist movement.

MACC assemblies are open to all anarchists, antifascists, anti-authoritarians and those interested in anarchist ideas and organizing so please invite your friends and share widely!

An orientation will precede the assembly starting at 6:30 PM for those interested in familiarizing themselves with MACC, the history, process and politics that underskirt general assemblies, and anarchist ideas. This orientation will also include information from our working group MASC OFF and their new Project SEAD focusing on Saf(er) Spaces, Accountability and so on within MACC. 

Tentative agenda:
(1) Welcome and introduction
(2) Report-backs and check-ins
(3) Breakouts
(4) Brief break out report-backs 
(5) Community Announcements
(6) Social at a nearby venue!
