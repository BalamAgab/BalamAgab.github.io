**General Assembly**

**Thursday, October 26th, 6:30PM @ Verso Books**

**20 Jay Street, Suite 1010, Brooklyn**

[Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1947211272167148)

The GA will begin @ 7:00 PM, orientation begins 6:30 PM.

MACC assemblies are open to all anarchists, antifascists, anti-authoritarians and those interested in anarchist ideas and organizing so please invite your friends and share widely!

If you haven't attended before, these assemblies are an opportunity to get plugged in with MACC, its various committees and working groups, and other NYC based anarchist projects.

There is an orientation before the assembly starting at 6:30 PM for those interested in familiarizing themselves with MACC, the history, process and politics that underskirt general assemblies, and anarchist ideas.

As with all assemblies, we encourage everyone to come with ideas about what they would like to see for future campaigns or actions and what direction they'd like MACC to take in terms of building a more powerful, militant anarchist movement.
