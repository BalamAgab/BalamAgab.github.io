The Base BK

Saturday, January 14th (7PM-8:30 PM)

## THE ASSEMBLY:

Thanks to everyone who braved the snowstorm for last week’s assembly – it was amazing to have a packed room despite the conditions.  As decided at the conclusion of that assembly, the Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council (MACC) is holding a follow-up assembly January 14th at The Base starting at 7 PM.  We’ll be continuing to finalize plans for the inauguration (Disrupt J20) including travel, action participation, convergence spaces and other logistics.  Please bring any updates you or your group might have about J20 in either DC or NYC.

We’ll also be discussing our horizon post-J20 - how MACC and our assembly model can be shaped and expanded by all participants in the years of struggle to come.

For more information on MACC please visit the website (MACC.nyc).  To sign up for announcements about future assemblies and organizing meetings visit http://macc.nyc/contact/.
MACC assemblies are open to all anarchists, so please invite and share widely to help us build an anarchist movement forum in NYC.

### MACC Introduction & the Assembly Model

#### About MACC:

The Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council is organized under the guiding principles of horizontalism, direct democracy and direct action. Through this umbrella we are building an anarchist movement forum in NYC greater than the sum of its parts. With the present atmosphere of xenophobia, racism, misogyny and the sense of ennui surrounding representational politics in America, we are making diverse anarchist projects visible to the world at large and seeding resistance to this emboldened right-wing with an alternative, radical form of participatory politics.

We seek to build on the diverse manifestations of these politics that have developed around the world – from Chiapas to Rojava, from the Movement of the Squares to Alterglobalization, from Syntagma Square to Zuccotti Park.  To this end, MACC currently exists as a series of monthly assemblies operating on modified consensus. With a “democracy of direct action” ethos, MACC is a coordinating (not mandating) body, ensuring our ability to address larger questions of strategy and narrative while protecting a plurality of voices and tactics. This means participating groups are free to determine their own internal structure and pursue their own vital projects. In this way, we demonstrate a vision for a society in fundamental opposition to the brutal logic of contemporary capitalism. A society based on mutual aid, cooperation, and radical democracy.
