The Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council sends greetings and respect to the Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs and matriarchs. MACC (situated in Lenapehoking, homeland of the Lenape people) stands in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en people as they defend their land, water and culture from violent invasion by the colonial Canadian government and the companies Chevron, Transcanada and Enbridge. 

Neither the Canadian state nor the capitalist interests behind the Coastal GasLink fracked gas pipeline have any respect for the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples. The pipeline project is an unambiguous continuation of centuries of colonial violence. The Wet’suwet’en people have never ceded land to the Canadian government. Any attempt by federal or provincial governments to police the Wet’suwet’en people is an attempt to claim territory without consent, and colonize the people who live there.

The Wet’suwet’en people have a moral and cultural imperative to defend and care for their territory. This imperative exists and persists outside of laws, treaties and other forms of colonial coercion. MACC celebrates the powerful resistance of the Wet’suwet’en people, who defend their territory against an environmentally disastrous fossil fuel pipeline and in doing so, defend the entire planet.
