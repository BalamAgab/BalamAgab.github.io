## Indigenous land

As the Metropolitan Anarchist Co-ordinating Committee (MACC) we recognize and respect that this is and always will be Indigenous land.

We acknowledge and respect the culture, the elders, past and present, of the Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga, Akwesasne Mohawk, Seneca Nations, Tuscarora, Unkechauge, Shinnecock, Poospatuck,  Tonawanda, and all other native peoples on whose land the MACC operates.

## Introduction
**TRIGGER WARNING – MACC Safer Spaces Policy mentions subjects such as; sexual assault, violence, intimate partner abuse, police violence. Please be aware that it might triggering, if you have experienced any of the above. Be aware that many discussed topics and ideas may affect you emotionally.**

This policy intends to be a positive, pro-active, preventative step towards making our community spaces safer. We use the word ‘safer’ to acknowledge that no space can be entirely safe for everyone and not everyone experiences spaces in the same way. This policy is not about policing others – it is about people monitoring themselves.

We have this safer spaces policy because we don’t live in a safe world. We live in a white supremacist, patriarchal capitalist society. This means that anyone who benefits from this privilege has more power over those that do not. Those who benefit from this privilege must be aware of how much space they are taking up, regardless of intent. MACC aims to create and perpetuate spaces that are safer than the outside world. We are growing an organization on Indigenous land. We are an organization that is radical, accessible, and which aims to be a safer space for indigenous, not-white, mixed race, migrant, queer, trans, intersex, femme, butch, a sex worker, have a disability, are non-neurotypical or are marginalized in other ways.

We want everyone who attends MACC held spaces to be aware of this safer spaces policy. We distribute this statement widely and will remind each other about it regularly.  We also send this statement to everyone who contacts us about collaborating with MACC so they are aware of the MACC policies and practices. Please alert your friends to the existence of this policy!

We hope that the very existence of this information will assist in the following ways:

* As a visible/constant reminder of everyone’s need to take responsibility for their own behavior
* To keep the issues fresh in everyone’s minds
* As a reminder that words, body language, actions and behavior affect other people and make them feel certain ways
* As a reminder to be aware of other people’s personal boundaries
* To work pro-actively and preventively
* To follow the grievance process
* To take responsibility for your own actions when confronting or addressing another, with whom you have a grievance.

## Act and treat people in the way you would like to be treated

We don't micro-monitor behavior within MACC spaces.  We expect that everyone in the MACC spaces will respect our policy and take responsibility for their own behavior. If you cross a person’s boundaries or offend another person, they may tell you that your behavior is inappropriate. Listen to them. If you continue your behavior, they may take their complaint to an individual MACC organizer or to MACC as a whole, who may raise these issues with you. There is more detail about the process for grievances further down in this policy.

It is helpful to be aware of body language, yours and anyone’s around you. If you notice that someone appears uncomfortable or distressed around you or someone else, take action. Ask if someone is ok, ask for a private word, or if they would like to leave a situation with you, should they choose. Do not decide for them, unless it is clear they are unable to extricate themselves and there is a clear and imminent danger.

We want MACC spaces to be welcoming, engaging and supportive. Spaces where people take care of one another while organizing and at times promoting lively and productive debate. We want people to feel they can be themselves and that different opinions are important and can strengthen our community. We are asking people to be proactive in creating a safer space that is comfortable for everyone present.

## Examining our own subtle and not-so-subtle prejudices

We concern ourselves about issues such as race, gender, sexuality, colonialism and other forms of oppression. Thus, we must live our lives in a way that pro-actively seeks to subvert prejudice and undermine discrimination. This means treating people equally and respectfully. This means acknowledging that everyone has something amazing to contribute. This means not being tokenistic. We view MACC spaces as alternative spaces where people reject the prejudices of ‘mainstream’ values. But, our communities often carry the same prejudices as the so-called mainstream and we all need to address this.

We are part of broader society. As individuals who are part of broader society, we are raised and partake in a culture that indoctrinates and socializes us to discriminate against others both consciously and unconsciously, formally and casually. As such, MACC wishes to differentiate between oppressive beliefs such as the below list, and socialized behavior which oppresses and erases, and which may not be done consciously or maliciously. Regardless of our intentions, the normalization of any belief, background, experience or identity over another causes tangible harm, and alienates and erases people who exist outside this ‘norm’. This behavior is also problematic, and must be challenged. If you are called on such behavior, it doesn’t mean you’re racist, sexist, homophobic etc., it means you’ve expressed behavior that is typical, but is in no way less serious. All of us must challenge our own internalized stigmas. By participating in making MACC spaces safer spaces, we can all learn how to overcome this programming in our communities every day.

People at MACC spaces are asked to be aware of their language and behavior and to think about whether it might be harmful to others. MACC will not abide by anyone being intolerant of another’s beliefs, lived experience, background, religious beliefs or lack thereof, or identity. MACC will not tolerate rape, sexual assault, any other form of violence, sexual harassment, creepy, predatory and/or sleazy behavior, racism, ageism, sexism, misogyny, homophobia, queerphobia, transphobia, transmisogyny, whorephobia, ableism, classism, sizeism, sex-negativity, cultural appropriation, or any other behavior or language that may perpetuate oppression.

Casually using strong/heavy words inappropriately can dilute meaning or alter it in the social context and do damage to the oppressed. Although certain derogatory words can be empowering when reclaimed, (like the term 'queer’ which has been reclaimed by the queer community), they are generally elements and instruments of oppression. Don’t joke about someone else’s experience of being oppressed, it’s no laughing matter, it’s just minimizing/denying of their experience to do so is an oppressive behavior itself.

Please also consider whether anxiety, new environments, being surrounded by new people, drugs, alcohol or other experiences could blur your ability to gage how your behavior is affecting others. With that said, MACC will not use any of the listed considerations as an excuse for inappropriate actions and expects individuals to develop an awareness of their behavioral tendencies in and outside of MACC spaces.

## What we need to do to create a safer space at MACC held spaces

We ask you not to make assumptions or judgments about someone’s sex, gender, pronouns, sexuality, race, culture, nationality, ethnicity, body, dis/ability, HIV status, neurotype, age, class, economic status, religion, occupation, identity, survivor status etc.

Respect people’s physical and emotional boundaries.

Always get explicit verbal consent before touching someone, crossing personal boundaries or sharing personal information about them with others.

Respect others. It does not matter what medium of expression is used, objectifying treatment of others is not ok, neither is treating others in a utilitarian way or as a resource for your exploitation (this means without explicit specific prior consent or arrangement).

Respect people’s opinions, beliefs, differing states of being and differing points of view.

Be responsible for your own actions. Be aware that your actions do have an effect on others. In practice, this means accepting personal responsibility and being prepared to be held accountable, despite whatever intentions. Disowning responsibility for your own actions by blaming others is not acceptable behavior. This also means actively listening, being open to the processes that MACC has in place to deal with grievances, treating the situation seriously and being prepared to take meaningful action as requested by whoever is affected/MACC organisers in a genuine effort to resolve things.

Take responsibility for your own safety and get help if you need it. Look out for kids and animals and everyone else’s safety as well.

Everyone is responsible for maintaining space we use. Leave any workspace/social space/communal spaces cleaner than you found them.

Let others volunteer information. If a person wants to share information about themselves with you, receive it with grace and dignity.

Don’t pressure others for information.
If a particular group has requested an autonomous or private space, and you are not part of that group, do not attend that group. It is the groups’ responsibility to be clear about who is welcome.

Some of the events in MACC held spaces may have a policy regarding substance use, and we'd appreciate it if you could take responsibility for your own consumption of substances when you're here at MACC spaces/events. Your level of intoxication is no excuse for poor behavior (as noted above).

## ‘Legally’ sensitive issues

While individuals may not believe in the rule of law when it comes to all matters, or in fact, at all, it is important to accept that MACC and associated groups, individuals and broader community may still be affected by it. In the interests of keeping MACC spaces free from police or other government presence we ask that you refrain from illegal activities in the space that would impact on MACC and its community unfairly and without consent; especially activities that tend to garner intense police interest such as selling stolen property, dealing drugs or stockpiling unlicensed guns just for example.

To be absolutely clear, we do not whatsoever hold victims or survivors of police harassment or violence responsible for said harassment or violence. We understand that at times individuals at public events may choose to do things outside of our knowledge and control, however, where those behaviors are not breaching the safer spaces policy and have no legal implications for anybody but the person whose activity it is, MACC deems that personal responsibility has been taken by the person/s involved. Also, it is a good idea to remember to use best Security Culture around legally sensitive issues; using sensitive issues as social currency puts everybody who hears it at risk legally as well as multiplies the possibility that the information, however accurate it may or may not be, may still end up having an adverse affect on those it is about, or others in the community.

If you are concerned that somebody is doing something that puts the MACC community at legal risk, try talking with them if you feel safe to do so; if not we suggest you bring it up with a MACC organizer or other active member and we can work together to keep the spaces safer. MACC held spaces are activist-friendly spaces and together we can keep it this way! 😁


## Pre-existing conflict

As members of many communities, we realize there are numerous conflicts that have a longer standing than that of MACCs existence.

MACC acknowledges that safer spaces policies deal better with conflicts that have arisen during the time of, or within, the MACC's spaces. MACC may attempt to take a step further by actively addressing pre-existing conflict here within the safer spaces policy, and aims to learn from and build upon its/our collective knowledge.

Firstly, MACC would like to state that it is the MACC’s intention to facilitate the greatest level of participation for all involved with MACC/attending events, whilst also maintaining a safer environment for everyone present. MACC does not wish to give those in MACC organized spaces unrealistic expectations, and thus MACC acknowledges that it can’t ‘solve’ all of the issues that it faces, and so it is, too, with pre-existing conflict. Some differences are too great, and no policy or mediated discussion will change that. Individuals involved in pre-existing conflict may have personal boundaries that mean that if another individual is present at a MACC event or space, the personal cost is such that they will leave the space/event. Thus, at times, individuals may be asked by MACC not to appear at a MACC space/event for a particular, finite period of time. Requesting an individual not attend a particular event/appear at MACC spaces at a particular time is the outcome of balancing competing needs for participation in a community and collective environment. This process and the negotiation of attendance will be balanced by MACC collectively or in some case by MACC organizers in as sensitive and transparent a manner (to those involved) as possible.

The safer spaces policy may make people feel that being requested to not attend at any particular time/event, means that they are on the “wrong” end of the policy, or are being judged or punished in some way. This is not the intention. MACC attempts to do the best that it can, and hopes that participants understand the limitations that we face as a small radical community of passionate volunteers.

Further, those attending MACC organized events or spaces must recognize that in doing so they agree to abide by MACCs safer spaces policy, and that by contravening this they are in fact excluding themselves of their own volition.

MACC would like to propose that we move away from the idea of fair participation as inclusion OR exclusion. Instead, we suggest we take the starting point for fair participation not as universal access participation but mutual respect for boundaries and care for one another.

## Intimate Partner Abuse

The insidious nature of this problem is so pervasive it often goes unchallenged, even in radical left communities. It can be difficult to spot but, if you are concerned about someone, there are a few things to look out for: if someone's behavior changes fairly consistently around their partner/s in a way that worries you, e.g. if they become subdued, depressive, defensive, quiet, nervous or anxious, jumpy, or feel shame, guilt, embarrassment, resignation, confusion/conflicting feelings, poor self image, fear, uncertainty etc. Often, abusive partners will go to great lengths to maintain control over their partner/s and secrecy of their own actions. If you notice someone is minimizing or denying their partner’s experiences, passions, ideas, body, abilities, identity etc., or is otherwise meting out harmful communication (to or about their partner), this is not to be ignored. This is a form of abuse.

If someone confides in you about current abuse or violence it can be difficult to know what to do next, but if you are able to offer any kind of support to the person to leave the relationship, to hold the violent/abusive partner accountable, to offer safe accommodation, access health services or to make an escape plan, these can be good support tactics. Physical violence may mean someone needs to leave immediately; support to do so is important to their safety and must be available whether through MACCs collective ability as a whole, or through MACC organizers or through individuals as ability allows, or referral to other services. Someone in this situation may be hesitant to ask for support and may not know or believe they are entitled to it. Listen to them non-judgmentally, or ask if you can find someone they trust. Remember their life situation is not gossip. Do not make decisions for them but encourage decision-making that puts their safety and well being first. Understand that someone in this position may not behave in ways that seem logical to someone who has no personal or intellectual understanding of being victimized or surviving such circumstances.

## Grievance Process

This Safer Spaces Policy is a survivor centric policy, which means that the needs of the survivors will be prioritized and their privacy will be respected at all times.

As soon as a situation or conflict arises, where possible, ensure your safety is prioritized. To avoid exposure to any potential escalation or triggers if you are feeling vulnerable, you might go to a quiet/safe space, talk to a friend, or approach a MACC organizer or active member (details below).

If you feel comfortable directly approaching the person whose behavior has caused you to feel unsafe/uncomfortable, you may try to resolve the issue between yourselves. Please do so while maintaining safer spaces yourself: being conscious of your own triggers and needs. If you cannot mediate the issue yourself, your first step is to approach a MACC organizer who may support your needs in seeking safety/resolution. At all times your privacy will be respected, and no more information than you are willing to share will be given to others.

A MACC organizer/contributor will check on how you are, and what your immediate needs may be. They will ask you to describe the conflict or situation that has arisen, and how it has made you feel.

With your permission, a MACC organizer (in an ideal situation, this will be another MACC organizer than the one you initially spoke to) will approach the other party to formally recognize the conflict, to get their side of the story, and to establish their needs. In situations involving an immediate threat to safety, the MACC member or resident may seek to escort the offending party from the premises at once.

The grievance process may be completed if an agreement between both parties can be reached about their needs, or by process of mediation. If not:

The next step is that appropriate MACC organizers will meet and mediate or come upon a resolution for MACC and the affected parties, if necessary. This is an absolute last step if an agreement cannot be reached through mediation. Banning people from MACC held spaces or individual forthcoming events is an absolute final resort and will only be done by consensus decision by either MACC organizers or specific MACC working groups as specifically affected.

## Contact for Grievance Process Support

To begin a grievance process please speak to any organizer at a general assembly, or contact anyone associated with MACC who you're comfortable speaking with.

Please note: If you decide to confront a person you have a grievance with, or ask a third party to do so on your behalf, or you have been asked to approach a person on behalf of another, keep in mind that YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS regardless of your grievance with another person. At no time are you acting on behalf of MACC organizers.

Individual grievance contacts are entitled to withdraw from the above process at any time if they find the conflict to be triggering, or to endanger their personal safety.

## Glossary

(of sometimes-difficult-to-understand terms)

### Ableism

Is a form of discrimination and social prejudice towards ‘disabled’ persons. It is apparent in many ways, i.e. the idea that ‘disabled’ persons are less worthy than ‘able-bodied’ persons, the idea that ‘disabled’ persons are unable to make decisions for themselves, a patronizing behavior or pitying behavior towards ‘disabled’ persons, lack of access to services, venues etc. for ‘disabled’ persons, and others.

### Active listening

Is the act of being fully present and available to somebody when they are speaking to you as opposed to merely conjuring your next argument against them while disregarding the validity of what they are expressing (i.e. cooperative inclusive dialog instead of dominating conversation, “argument winning”, or unsolicited monologue).

### Ageism

Is stereotyping and discriminating against individuals or groups on the basis of their age. This may be casual or systematic. Examples of this can be prejudicial attitudes towards older people and the aging process and institutional practices and policies that perpetuate stereotypes about and discrimination against older people or people of any specific “age group”.

### Butch

A person who is expressing or identifies (whether physically, mentally, or emotionally) as what can be described as ‘masculine’ according to societal norms regardless of their gender/sex. Butch expression may or may not be perceived to be more exaggerated than expected by societal norms.

### Cis

Refers to a person whose gender identity matches the sex officially assigned to them at birth based on their sex chromosomes, external genitalia, internal reproductive systems, or hormones.

### Classism

Is a differential treatment towards others based on social class or perceived social class. Classism is the systematic oppression of subordinated class groups to advantage and strengthen the dominant class groups. It is the systematic assignment of characteristics of worth and ability based on social class. This includes: individual attitudes and behaviors; systems of policies and practices that are set up to benefit the upper classes at the expense of the lower classes; the culture that perpetuates them. Classism is held in place by a system of beliefs and cultural attitudes that ranks people according to economic status, family lineage, job status, level of education, and other divisions.

### Consent

Is an act of actively and consciously saying YES to something. This means that a person who gives consent has to be conscious, fully aware and understanding, sober, under no threat, coercion or deception and has to verbally and clearly indicate that they agree to whatever it is they are consenting to. Consent is often talked about in context of sexual acts, touching etc. In relation to this, it is important to understand that nothing but a verbally given YES means consent (i.e. silence, drunkenness, body language, flirtatious behavior, ‘not sure’, ‘maybe’, previously given consent etc. are NOT consent).

### Cultural appropriation

Is the adoption of some specific elements of one culture by a different cultural group/individual. It can include the introduction of forms of dress or personal adornment, music and art, religion, language or social behavior. These elements, once removed from their indigenous cultural contexts, can take on meanings that are significantly divergent from, or merely less nuanced than those they originally held.

### Femme

A person who is expressing or identifies (whether physically, mentally, or emotionally) as what can be described as feminine according to societal norms regardless of gender/sex. Femme expression may or may not be perceived to be more exaggerated than expected by societal norms.

### Gender

Is a range of physical, biological, mental and behavioral characteristics that comprise an identity, which in the current societal binary way of perceiving gender, is either masculine or feminine (while these are the only officially recognized genders, many people identify as i.e. both, neither, genderqueer). This term is also being used to refer to biological sex and sex-based social structures (including gender roles and other social roles).
An individuals gender is something only they may define for themselves. Gender is not the same as whatever sex someone has been assigned with at birth.

### Homophobia

Encompasses a range of negative attitudes, feelings and behaviors towards homosexuality or/and people who identify or are perceived as being lesbian, gay, bisexual. This includes both interpersonal and institutionalized discrimination. This can be expressed as antipathy, contempt, prejudice, aversion, hatred, hostile behavior and violence.

### Intersex

From a medical perspective this is a naturally occurring state that affects the reproductive and sexual system. Intersex people are born with sex chromosomes, external genitalia, internal reproductive systems, or hormones that a doctor has a difficult time categorizing as either male or female as they differ from expected patterns. The existence of intersexuals is evidence of the reality that there are not just two sexes and that binary ways of thinking about sex (trying to force everyone to fit into the male or female box) are socially constructed.

### Misogyny

Is the hatred or dislike of women. This can be manifested in numerous ways, including sexual discrimination, violence against women and sexual objectification of women.

### Non-hierarchical

Refers to the conscious act of creating equitable relations and/or organizational structure through dismantling existing social and structural norms that facilitate and reinforce power over others, oppression of others, and privilege. In practical terms this also means working to create and use horizontal organizational structures, recognizing unspoken social and organizational hierarchies and exposing them, learning about power dynamics and how to create healthier ones, actively reflecting on and addressing internalized patterns of dominance and control with specific devotion of personal time and energy to positively change them (i.e. self monitoring), being mindful of how you react to other people and how they react to you, learning about your privilege and undermining it intentionally. Its means supporting everyone to be empowered. ☺

### Non-neurotypical

Is a person whose brain does not work in the way that is considered “normal” i.e. atypical neurology. Examples of what is currently considered non-neurotypical include: autism spectrum, dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, ADD/ADHD. Although this term is most commonly used with regards to autism spectrum its definition has broadened in more recent times.

### Non-violent communication

Is the practice of self-awareness in relation to communication with others. It places importance on constructive dialog, deescalation of unnecessary aggression, consideration of situational context, trying to understand where others are coming from, respecting each other’s limitations, being aware of how your tone or volume may be interpreted by others, listening actively, relinquishing selfishness while giving respect to both yourself and others.

### Objectification

Means treating a person as a thing, without regard to their dignity. This is both on interpersonal and societal level. This includes using a person as a tool for another’s purposes; as if lacking in agency or self-determination; as if owned by another; as in interchangeable; as if permissible to damage; as if there is no need for concern for their feelings and experiences. Sexual objectification means treating a person merely as an instrument of sexual pleasure and is most commonly directed at women; it is also perpetuated by societal norms, media, ‘rape culture’, institutions etc.

### Patriarchy

An overarching hierarchical structure within society that is perpetuated by both individuals and institutions in which male-presenting/male assigned at birth individuals tacitly benefit and/or are overtly rewarded by the existing inequalities and power dynamics inherent in structures made by cis-men for their specific benefit and maintenance of power over all others (this exists despite tokenistic inclusion of non-cis men within their realms of acceptance). Male privilege is a product of this dynamic (as well as others). This issue is further obscured in official education/propaganda on the matter with insufficient and/or inaccurate information readily available to the general public. When ‘male privilege’ is invisible to cis-men it is generally because they are either benefiting from it or otherwise not recognizing its negative impacts.

### Predatory behavior

A type of behavior used by someone who knowingly or unknowingly uses circumstances of age difference, being new to an organization or organizing in general, and other assumptions of unconsented invitations to be taken advantage of, to gain sexualized power and control over another person in a demeaning and non-consensual way.

### Pronouns

There are more pronouns than the masculine and feminine and that they don’t have to be gender-specific. Examples of gender-neutral pronouns are: singular they; co; phe; ‘e (with ‘s instead of his/hers and ‘h instead of him/her); zhe, ze or zher, zer, zir (with shi or hir instead of his/hers and zhim or mer instead of him/her); hu (with hus instead of his/hers, hum instead of him/her and humself instead of himself/herself). Those pronouns may be used when talking about genderqueer persons, when gender is not known or in order not to differentiate genders at all. It is a good idea to ask others what pronoun they would like to be referred to with, instead of assuming it.

### Queer

Is an umbrella term for LGBTIQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans*, intersex, queer, questioning) community and the term used by some individuals in that community to describe themselves and/or show affinity with others of that community. To identify as queer can as well be a political statement against hetero-normativity, hetero-sexism, socially proscribed gender roles and/or relationship structures (i.e. monogamy). However, it is important to understand that not everybody who identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, or intersex will identify as queer.

### Queerphobia

Refers to a range of negative attitudes, feelings and behaviors towards queerness or/and people who identify or are perceived as being queer, gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans, intersex and generally not hetero-normative. This includes both interpersonal and institutionalized discrimination. This can be expressed as antipathy, contempt, prejudice, aversion, hatred, hostile behavior and violence.

### Racism

Is generally defined as interpersonal and institutional actions, practices, beliefs as well as social or/and political systems that are based on the idea that the human species are divided into ‘races’ with shared traits, abilities, qualities, or other cultural behavioral characteristics, and especially that those ‘races’ can be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to others or/and that members of different ‘races’ should be treated differently. This includes violent, symbolic, normalized (i.e. jokes, stereotypes) as well as institutionalized discrimination against a particular group of people defined as one ‘race’ or another.

### Rape

Is an act of forcing on another person a sexual contact or/and penetration without consent or with use of physical force, coercion, or deception. Rape is considered a crime in most places, however it is defined differently in various so-called countries and states. Its legal definitions are often incomplete. What specific sexual contact and/or what specific way of penetration is and is not considered rape may also vary from person to person, which means it is difficult to propose a specific and detailed definition.  However, we believe that in cases of acts of sexual assault it is the survivors of such acts whose definition and experience of it is most important in considering given act as rape or not.

### Sex

Is a biological trait based on differences in gametes (genetic trait that individual organisms inherit from parents) and combinations of chromosomes and reproductive organs. Organisms of many species, including humans, are born ‘with’ a sex. Those sexes are: female, male and intersex (in dated terms hermaphroditic), which is when an organism produces both male and female gametes. Sex is a medical specification and is not the same a gender.

### Sex-negativity

Refers to opposition to one or more aspects of human sexuality or/and sexual behavior on social or religious grounds. This means generally perceiving sex as destructive, degrading, ‘sinful’ etc. as well as ranking sexualities and sexual acts hierarchically, with procreative marital heterosexuality at the top and masturbation, homosexuality and other sexualities and sexual acts and behaviors at the bottom. This includes prohibitionist approach, puritan approach and other personal beliefs and attitudes that are in opposition to any or more than one specific sexuality or/and sexual behavior.


### Sex worker

Can include anyone who does any of the following work for some kind of reward (cash or otherwise agreed): phone sex operator, sexy web-cam operator, street based sexual service provider, brothel based sexual service provider, private escort, peep-show dancer, stripper (in strip clubs, or privately e.g. strip-o-grams), sensual massage servicer who also provides (most often) limited sexual services, porn star, live sex show provider; some services and work carried out in professional BDSM dungeons or by BDSM professionals may also be considered sex work. This is not to be considered an exhaustive list. People who own or manage establishments where such services are offered are not themselves sex-workers, nor are writers about (real or fiction) or other documenters of aforementioned sexual service providers.

### Sexism

Is a prejudice, beliefs, practices, discrimination and stereotyping behaviors against a person of specific sex or/and gender.  These are personal beliefs and prejudices, interpersonal behaviors as well institutional, societal and political discrimination (typically against wimmin). Sexist attitudes may stem from traditional stereotypes of gender roles, cultural or/and religious beliefs, or misogyny. They may include the belief that a person of one sex is intrinsically superior to a person of the other.  They may result in sexual harassment, rape and other forms of sexual violence (typically against wimmin).

### Sexual assault

Is an act of forcing on another person a sexual act without their consent or/and against their will or/and with use of physical force, coercion, deception. Boundaries of what may be named sexual assault and what may be named rape are a gray area and difficult to define specifically and in detail. Similarly boundaries of what may be named sexual assault and what may be named sleazy or inappropriate behavior are a gray area and we believe that the definition and experience of survivors of those acts are most important in considering given act as either. The best way to make sure that sexual assault is not committed in any situation is to ALWAYS ASK and get CONSENT for everything and anything considered sexual or potentially crossing others’ boundaries.

### Sizeism

Is a discriminatory behavior and attitude based on the belief that certain ‘size’, weight or height is better than another. It also includes stereotyping about size (i.e. ‘overweight people are lazy or less attractive’, ‘skinny people are mean or sick’ etc.). This type of discrimination can take a number of forms, ranging from refusing to hire someone because they are too short, too tall, too small or too big, treating overweight and underweight individuals with disdain, laughing and joking about someone’s ‘size’, weight or height etc.

### Sleazy behavior

TODO

### Tokenism

Is a symbolic gesture to or inclusion of excluded specific groups of people or an individual with the covert aim of diffusing validity of criticism or action against whomever is offering said gesture or inclusion. This strategy has been and is also commonly used by powerful individuals and organizations (such as governments and corporations) to destroy large-scale resistance by offering largely useless reform in place of social revolution or affirmative action (generally by co-opting the allegiance of prominent but often benign adversaries).

### Trans*

Refers to a person whose gender identity does not match the sex officially assigned at birth based on their sex chromosomes, external genitalia, internal reproductive systems, or hormones. A person who identifies as trans* may or may not decide to or have gender (sex?) re-assignment surgery/gender affirming surgery to change their physical appearance.

### Transmisogyny

Is a term that describes how traditional sexism - the belief that ‘maleness’ and ‘masculinity’ are superior to ‘femaleness’ and ‘femininity’ - is applied to transgendered wimmin in the attempt to enforce the traditional patriarchy. It includes antipathy, discrimination, hatred, violence, ridiculing or otherwise sanctioning transgendered wimmin for expressing their ‘femaleness’ or ‘femininity’.

### Transphobia

Encompasses a range of negative attitudes, feelings and behaviors towards people who identify or are perceived as trans*. This includes both interpersonal and institutionalized discrimination. This can be expressed as antipathy, contempt, prejudice, aversion, hatred, hostile behavior and violence. It also includes an idea that the sex officially assigned to a person at their birth must be their gender and what they identify with.

### White supremacy

Includes both institutional as well as interpersonal racism perpetrated and perpetuated by white people and institutions created by and for the benefit of white people only (this exists despite tokenistic inclusion of non-white people within their realms of acceptance).

### Whorephobia

Is the fear or the hate of and discrimination or prejudice against sex workers. It also embraces paternalistic attitudes that deem sex workers a public nuisance, spreaders of disease, offenders against decency or unskilled victims who don't know what is good for them and who need to be rescued. It also shows in disrespect and violence towards sex workers.
