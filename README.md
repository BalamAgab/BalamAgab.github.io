After making a change, always check out the [live site](http://macc.nyc/) a few minutes later to make sure it's working! If you broke your page (or the whole site ðŸ˜±), don't fret, it's easy to fix up. Get in touch with someone from the comms or tech groups and we'll jump on it.

# Create a new post

Open the [_posts](_posts) folder.

Click "Create a new file".

Name the file `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`. For example, an assembly on August 21st 2017, would use `2017-08-21-general-assembly`.

Paste this at the top of the file:
```
---
title:
date:
layout: post
author: MACC NYC
---

Post content here!
```

Fill in the date and title. The date should be in the same format as the file name, `<year>-<month>-<day>`.

Replace `Post content here!` with your post! You can just put in plain text, or for fancier formatting, check out [Markdown docs](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

At the bottom click "Commit new file" and your post will go live in a few minutes!
