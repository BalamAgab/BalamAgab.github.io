  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>The Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council is organized under the guiding principles of horizontalism, direct democracy and direct action.  Through this umbrella we are building an anarchist movement forum in NYC greater than the sum of its parts.  With the present atmosphere of xenophobia, racism, misogyny and the sense of ennui surrounding representational politics in America, we are making diverse anarchist projects visible to the world at large and seeding resistance to this emboldened right-wing with an alternative, radical form of participatory politics.</p>

  <h2>Format</h2>



<p>MACC currently exists as a series of monthly assemblies operating on modified consensus.  With a “democracy of direct action” ethos, MACC is a coordinating (not mandating) body, ensuring our ability to address larger questions of strategy and narrative while protecting a plurality of voices and tactics.  This means participating groups are free to determine their own internal structure and pursue their own vital projects.  In this way, we demonstrate a vision for a society in fundamental opposition to the brutal logic of contemporary capitalism.  A society based on mutual aid, cooperation, and radical democracy.</p>



<p>Meeting minutes are made available to all participants (sign up at macc.nyc/contact for assembly announcements and minutes).  Preliminary assembly agendas are created in monthly MACC organizing meetings.</p>


<p>MACC is open to all anarchists.</p>

 <h2>From the First Invitation</h2>
      <p>The legacy of the abolitionist struggle has defined the momentum towards liberation in this country. We’re continuing that tradition of abolitionism to address our current forms of oppression: anti-black racism, deportation of Latinos, and hatred towards Muslim communities. The abolition of the prison, detention systems, and judicial system is the first step towards liberation, and breaking apart American society at its core.</p>

    <p>Direct action is the most effective tool against fascism, and it forms the core of our community self-defense strategy. While we stand against representation as a political basis, we encompass a multiplicity of tactics and approaches to work towards our revolutionary horizon. </p>

    <p>The decentralized cantons of Rojava provide a model, in their foundation of feminism, anti-capitalism and a commune-based political organization.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://catnyc.org/">CAT-NYC (Community Action Team)</a>:</h2>
    <p>
    Community Action Team NYC (CAT-NYC) is a voluntary network of people interested in providing support to NYC neighborhoods during Trump’s regime. CAT works along with people in neighborhoods who must defend themselves against bigoted attacks and will not allow any fascist to threaten the diversity of New York City.
    </p>
    <p>
    CAT is a network of New Yorkers who are organized around anarchist principles of voluntary association, horizontalism, solidarity, and mutual aid.

    <h2><a href="http://www.supportrojava.org/">Rojava Solidarity-NYC</a>:</h2>
    <p>
    Rojava Solidarity-NYC is a solidarity committee that seeks to provide information on Democratic Confederalism and the Rojava Revolution, as well as humanitarian aid to the people of Rojava.  In this way, ordinary people in the US can connect with the revolution in Rojava, joining with the amazing men and women in Northern Syria fighting for a new democratic, pluralistic, feminist and ecological future for not only the region but the world.  RS-NYC has undertaken a number of initiatives including: fundraising for the delivery of life saving trauma kits, holding screenings, talks and demonstrations, publishing one of the first English language books on the Rojava Revolution (A Small Key Can Open a Large Door, 2015), and producing articles and interviews on the Rojava Revolution as anarchist theory in practice.

    <h2><a href="nycabc.wordpress.com">NYC Anarchist Black Cross</a>:</h2>
    <p>
    NYC Anarchist Black Cross (NYC ABC) is a collective focused on supporting US-held political prisoners and prisoners of war and opposing state repression against revolutionary social justice movements. We are a Support Group of the Anarchist Black Cross Federation. For over ten years, NYC ABC has been hosting every-other-week letter-writing dinners for PPs and POWs, most recently and currently at The Base. For more information about NYC ABC, our events and other resources, visit nycabc.wordpress.com or find us everywhere else at @nycabc.

    <h2><a href="https://themastproject.wordpress.com/">Jane Addams Circle: Mutual Aid Self Therapy (MAST)</a>:</h2>
    <p>MAST is an open-source and evolving set of cognitive techniques aimed at promoting better emotional health for individuals in a non-hierarchical or medical model.
    </p>
    <p>MAST is not traditional psychotherapy nor is it group therapy. MAST uses the principle of mutual aid and a growing open source collection of techniques to help overcome emotional difficulties in their lives. MAST is not a substitute, nor does it seek to undermine, traditional psychotherapy and psychiatry but to provide a rational and effective self-therapy based on our radical principles. MAST was started by professional mental health professionals but seeks to create an effective and supportive practice to improve one’s mental wellness together with other people sharing their desire for a radical change in society.

    <h2><a href="https://wobblycity.org/">Industrial Workers of the World – NYC GMB</a>:</h2>
    <p>
    The IWW is a grassroots, worker-run, international union for all workers in all workplaces, dedicated to organizing both on and off the job, in our industries and our communities. Founded in 1905, we stand by the principles written in our Preamble, that the working class and the employing class have nothing in common, and that the wage system must be abolished. By organizing industrially, rather than by trade, we are forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old. </p>

  <h2><a href="http://mutantlegal.info/?page_id=147">Mutant Legal</a>:</h2>
    <p>
    Mutant Legal is a collective of legal activists in New York City organizing within a framework of radical care and anti-oppression. Our projects involve collaboration and education with and in support of peoples’ movements and marginalized communities traditionally excluded from access to meaningful justice. We agitate around issues of law and justice from a clear understanding that those two things are not the same.

   <h2>Radical Gardeners NYC</h2>
   <p>Radical Gardeners NYC is a network of novice and experienced gardeners who connect to share gardening tips and resources from an autonomous, anti-capitalist perspective.</p>
   <p>We hold sessions out of the Base where we organize collective, often subversive, public space gardening projects, host presentations and maintain an open seed saving library.</p>
   <p>This season, radical gardeners will be liberating plants from displaced gardener's homes, grafting fruit bearing branches to ornamental trees, and expanding to grow free food in nearby lots.</p>

    <h2>Fight Training</h2>
     <p>As the fighters in Rojava have said, we fight better when we fight in the right way - the right way in this case is with the solid relationships between folks. Many of us have been training independently, and many have expressed a need to increase their skills in this arena. We invite folks to come together to get to know each other better, to help each other learn new techniques and practice old ones. </p>
     <p>The Fight Training programs at The Base are free, weekly martial arts workshops, focusing on giving folks the skills they need to defend themselves and others in their community. All classes are good for beginners and intermediate practitioners. The program consists of the following classes:</p>
     <p><b>Women, Trans, GNC, NB Class </b>- Every other Monday, sharing crucial self-defense skills with folks of marginalized gender identities.</p>
     <p><b>Fight Training </b>- With a different theme every Thursday, this class teaches a variety of MMA, grappling, self-defense, and weapon-defense techniques, as well as special programming and workshops.</p>
     <p><b>Martial Universe </b>- Every Sunday, focusing on a variety of styles, skill sharing, and general open practice</p>

     <p>Protect ya neck with Fight Training!</p>

    <h2>Antifa Discussion</h2>
    <p>From an intersectional lens, the Antifa Discussion Series is a regularly-meeting group that focuses on discussing the purpose, history, theory, and application of Anti-Facist action. Each meeting will center around a theme, ranging from Antifa and Feminism, to Antifa and The Civil Rights Movement, to Antifa and Queer/Trans Activism, and much more!</p>

    <p>We are a non-cumulative "101" course, meaning that you do not have to know much about the topic to attend, and that you do not need to attend all the meetings to be a part of the group. We try to promote a bottom-up approach to understanding (meaning that if you feel like you know a lot about Antifa, but want to be a part of this group, we ask that you make space for those who are trying to come into an understanding of the topic.</p>

    <h2>Crypto Squad NYC</h2>
    <p>Can I be tracked? How can I be hacked? Who sees what I do online? If you are interested in a better understanding of any of these questions, or if you are a seasoned cryptographer who just wants to kick it with some cybersecurity-minded folks, Crypto Squad NYC is a group devoted to creating workshops and socials, as well as sharing information with interested folks and groups! Join us at one of our events, and learn how you can be secure in your digital dealings.</p>
