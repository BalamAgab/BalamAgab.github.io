    - name: MACC Legal Support
      link: /legal
      description: MACC Legal Support was born specifically out of the state repression faced by NYC comrades who were kettled and arrested, and forced to face brutal conditions of detention on January 20th, 2017, during the massive protests against Trump’s explicitly white supremacist and patriarchal regime.  We are expecting an even higher level of repression in the coming months and years, as anarchists and other militants prepare to fight the outright rise of fascism, neo-naziism, and the alt-right.  MACC Legal is a committee of the NYC Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council, which is organized under the guiding principles of horizontalism, direct democracy and direct action.

    - name: MACC Press
      description: >
        The dual function of MACC Press is to respond to queries from outside journalists and to create our own movement media. With the recent surge of interest in radical forms of political struggle, words like "antifa," "black bloc," and "anarchist" are entering the common parlance of even mainstream press outlets. We believe that right now we have an unprecedented opportunity to add depth to the wider public's understanding of anarchist politics and to expand our movement. MACC Press is created in solidarity with the many radical initiatives already doing great work nationally and in the New York area. Our aim is to serve these initiatives as a ready tool: this includes acting as press liaisons for groups who would like to disseminate information about their projects, but lack media infrastructure or cannot speak directly to media for fear of compromising their members. Through a number of means - whether articles, video, artwork, social media or interviews - MACC Press is dedicated to resisting today's proto-fascism in the public sphere - with the pen as well as in the streets.

      description: >
        MAST is an open-source and evolving set of cognitive techniques aimed at promoting better emotional health for individuals in a non-hierarchical or medical model.
        MAST is not traditional psychotherapy nor is it group therapy. MAST uses the principle of mutual aid and a growing open source collection of techniques to help overcome emotional difficulties in their lives. MAST is not a substitute, nor does it seek to undermine, traditional psychotherapy and psychiatry but to provide a rational and effective self-therapy based on our radical principles. MAST was started by professional mental health professionals but seeks to create an effective and supportive practice to improve one’s mental wellness together with other people sharing their desire for a radical change in society.

Founded in 1905, we stand by the principles written in our Preamble, that the working class and the employing class have nothing in common, and that the wage system must be abolished.

We meet every other Friday, and have regular letter writing events, prison visits, court support appearances, and more.

      description: Lower Manhattan Food Not Bombs is an organization that calls attention to the misplaced priorities of the current system by providing healthful and delicious vegan meals to the public for free. One part community service and one part political activism, our very presence stands both as proof of the current system's failures in providing adequate food for the people and as a way to mitigate those same failures. We meet 1 p.m. every Sunday at the Catholic Worker to cook, and serve at Tompkins Square Park from about 4:30 to 6 p.m. We're always looking for more help.

    - name: Fight Training
      description: >
         As the fighters in Rojava have said, we fight better when we fight in the right way - the right way in this case is with the solid relationships between folks. Many of us have been training independently, and many have expressed a need to increase their skills in this arena. We invite folks to come together to get to know each other better, to help each other learn new techniques and practice old ones.
         The Fight Training programs at The Base are free, weekly martial arts workshops, focusing on giving folks the skills they need to defend themselves and others in their community. All classes are good for beginners and intermediate practitioners. The program consists of the following classes:
         <br/><b>Women, Trans, GNC, NB Class </b>- Every other Monday, sharing crucial self-defense skills with folks of marginalized gender identities.
         <br/><b>Fight Training </b>- With a different theme every Thursday, this class teaches a variety of MMA, grappling, self-defense, and weapon-defense techniques, as well as special programming and workshops.

We try to promote a bottom-up approach to understanding (meaning that if you feel like you know a lot about Antifa, but want to be a part of this group, we ask that you make space for those who are trying to come into an understanding of the topic.
